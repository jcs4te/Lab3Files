<h2>CS3240, Lab 3, Fall 2014<br>
Lab on Persistent Data</h2>
Note:&nbsp; I've included the info from the Reading assignment that you
were to complete before coming to lab in this document.&nbsp; You can
skip to the end to start the activities.&nbsp; But the Readings info is
included if you need to refer back to what you looked at.<br>
<br>
<h3>1. Readings before Lab<br>
</h3>
Read the following before coming to lab.&nbsp; Lab will involve
exercises based on the concepts and techniques shown in these
reading.&nbsp; So you don't have to know everything in the readings
perfectly before lab, nor do you have to try out any coding. But
knowing the concepts and ideas beforehand is necessary to complete the
exercises in lab on Monday.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">(A) File I/O:&nbsp; </span>Read
through a tutorial on file I/O, for example <a
 href="http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files">this</a>
from the Python tutorial.&nbsp;&nbsp; (We don't think you'll need to
know much at this time about the binary modes for Windows. But if
you're a Windows user,
you may need to come back to this later.)&nbsp; What you should
understand is:<br>
<ol>
  <li>How to open a file for reading and writing.</li>
  <li>How to use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">with</span>
statement for files and why.</li>
  <li>How to read a file line by line and process it.</li>
</ol>
(B)&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">JSON:&nbsp; </span>This
stands for
JavaScript Object Notation, and this has become a very popular way of
encoding object data for persisentence or interchange with other
programs (even in other languages). All major languages have nice JSON
libraries.&nbsp; <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Data_types.2C_syntax_and_example">This
section</a> of the Wikipedia article on JSON shows an example of
something stored in JSON format.&nbsp; Note that JSON has the idea of
an <span style="font-style: italic;">Object</span>, which is key-value
pairs surrounded by curly-brackets (so it's a lot like a Python
dictionary), and an Array, which is a sequence of items surrounded by
square-brackets (like a Python list).&nbsp; So you already speak JSON!<br>
<br>
Python has a module json <a
 href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html">documented here</a>
for serializing and de-serializing data. Glance at this, but you don't
need to learn this in detail before lab.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">(C)&nbsp;&nbsp; Databases and SQL:</span><br>
Databases provide a way to store large amounts of data, process it
efficiently and with flexibility, and share the data among users. The <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">SQL</span> is a standard query language for
interacting with <span style="font-weight: bold;">relational databases</span>,
which is a approach to organizing a database as a set of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">tables</span> that store information in <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">rows</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">columns</span>.&nbsp; A row typically
stores data for one "entry", while the columns correspond to particular
attributes.<br>
<br>
There are many database products that implement SQL.&nbsp; Many of
these run as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">database server</span>,
an application running on a networked machine that client code can
connect to. These include MySQL, Postgres, and many others. <br>
<br>
Another approach is to use an <span style="font-style: italic;">embedded</span>
database system, where the database is running on the same machine as
the application and does not run as a separate server process.&nbsp; We
will go that route in today's lab, using a database implementation
called <span style="font-weight: bold;">sqlite3</span>, which comes
installed with Python.&nbsp; You can start up sqlite3 from the command
line and enter commands into its comand-line interpreter (CLI), just
like you can do with Python and other interpreted languages.&nbsp; This
is a good way to create databases, create tables, see the state of the
database, etc.&nbsp; But you can also write a Python program that
connects to a database, reads or modifies data, performs searches and
other operations.<br>
<br>
There's a lot to learn about SQL and databases (we have a entire course
on it), but today we want to give you a taste.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">(D) sqlite3 and Python</span>:<br>
<br>
Windows users:&nbsp; You almost certainly need to install sqlite to use
it.&nbsp; See the instructions <a
 href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_installation.htm">here</a>.<br>
Ubuntu users:&nbsp; You may need to use apt-get to install it.<br>
Mac users:&nbsp; It should come already installed.<br>
<br>
Here are links to some short tutorials on using sqlite3 with Python:<br>
<ol>
  <li><a
 href="http://www.openbookproject.net/courses/python4fun/sqlschool.html">http://www.openbookproject.net/courses/python4fun/sqlschool.html</a><br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://zetcode.com/db/sqlitepythontutorial/">http://zetcode.com/db/sqlitepythontutorial/</a></li>
</ol>
The first of these does a nice job of focusing on using sqlite3 from
the CLI, including creating databases and tables and putting info into
a database.&nbsp; From it you'll see the syntax of some basic commands
in SQL.<br>
<br>
The second of these does a better job of showing you how to use sqlite3
from within Python to access data in the database.&nbsp; To do that,
you'll need to know about the SQL commands of course, since in Python
you make calls to functions and pass an SQL command as an argument.<br>
<p>

<h3>
2. Lab Activities</h3>
<p>
Look for files in the Resources area of Collab, in the Lab 3 section.<br>
</p>
Our goal in lab today is to process a large file of information by
loading it
into a database and the executing queries on it to carry out operations.<br>
<p>
We have a file in CSV format, and to input that into the database,
you'd need to explore Python's module for processing CSV files.&nbsp;
(It's pretty nice and simple.)<br>
</p>
<p>In Collab Resources you will find a data file called <b>seas-courses-5years.csv</b>
that has these columns:<br>
<code>deptID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; courseNum&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
semester&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meetingType&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
seatsTaken&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seatsOffered&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; instructor</code><br>
This data is enrollment information for courses taught in SEAS over
five years.<br>
</p>
<p>You'd need to create a database and a table for this info <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">outside of Python</span> before running any
program.&nbsp; A common technique is to create a shell script (Unix) or
.BAT file (Windows) that does this so you can run and re-run
this.&nbsp; It might look something like the following (and this file
is on Collab), and can be used
in Unix and Windows by typing: sqlite3 crawled.db &lt; create_table.sql</p>
<p>The following shows you want this might look like, but this is not
complete, i.e. it does not match the columns listed above.&nbsp; (We've
given you a correct version in the Resources area of Collab.)<br>
</p>
<pre>DROP TABLE IF EXISTS coursedata;<br>CREATE TABLE coursedata (deptID text, seatsTaken int);<br></pre>
<p>
Then write a Python program that:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Reads the data from the file and puts it into the database;</li>
  <li>Finds all records for CS courses, and</li>
  <li>Creates a dictionary that records how many students each
instructor taught, and</li>
  <li>Creates a 2nd dictionary that records how many students enrolled
in each unique CS class.</li>
  <li>If you have time, update your program so it prompts for a deptID
and then does this processing for that department (not just CS).<br>
  </li>
</ol>
Feel free to do some kind of variation on this.<br>
<p><b>Note: How to read data?</b>&nbsp; Python has a module for working
with CSV
files.&nbsp; Search http://docs.python.org/ for info on the csv module.
You'll need to open the file in "universal new-line mode" as follows:
</p>
<pre>with open('seas-courses-5years.csv', 'rU') as csvfile:<br></pre>
<p><b>Note: How to embed SQL in a Python program?</b>&nbsp; You need to
know how to do this correctly, or security issues can follow.&nbsp; Use
Google to find a discussion of how to do this, and then see the .py
file in the Collab Resources area for examples. Study this and make
your code follow good practice.<br>
</p>
<h3>3. Submission</h3>
Submit what files you have at the end of the lab.&nbsp; In the text box
for the submission, briefly state how much you got done, what you feel
like you didn't learn well, etc.<br>
